# sre-take-home

Your mission: To stand up and have a publicly-hosted end point available on port 8080 that we can access and get 200 response!

We want to see your creativity, but we have a few constraints for the exercise:

- Use of load balancer 
  - Round robin or other demonstrated configuration
- Use of Security Groups
- Uses containers
- Use Terraform to Reproduce your work  
- Repo documented with a README.md file 
- Document the general approach you'd use to incorporate this into CI/CD

Nice to have: 
- Logs routed to Cloudwatch
- Documentation on approach to shipping updates to the solution with minimal / no downtime

For this, please use the honor method in your time spent - we look for 2-3 hours for this, respecting your time and supporting work/life balance, your commitments to things other than interviewing. <3

If we move forward with you to the next step in the interview process, we will be looking to meet with you to discuss your solution. We are curious about how you would scale the solution, have the solution be included in CI/CD, possible refactor work, and other related questions.

Once completed, please email the solution over to kelly.dunn at splice.com.

Have fun, and good luck! 

Jerius, Chris, Ben and Kelly.
