# SRE Exercise

Thank you for applying to join the Splice SRE team!

To serve as a springboard for discussion when we meet with you in real-time, we would you to think through/plan out an approach to a scenario that we can talk through together with you. Your mission: to run a simple, publicly-hosted HTTP service! We have a few details and constraints that weâ€™d like you to be prepared to speak to:
- Use of load balancer
- Use of security groups
- Uses containers
- Use of Terraform to reproduce your work
- Logging and monitoring
- Documentation around your approach
- Incorporation into CI/CD
- Approach to shipping updates to the solution with minimal / no downtime

We want to get an understanding of your experience and your creativity, discuss possible alternative approaches to some of these areas, the related tradeoffs, and what areas might be really easy and what errors might be challenging.

We look forward to talking through this with you!
